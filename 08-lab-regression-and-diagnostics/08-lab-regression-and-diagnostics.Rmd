## "Advances in Development Reverse Fertility Declines" {.smaller .build}

Today we will be working on the recent, important paper in Nature by Mikko Myrskyla, Hans-Peter Kohler & Francesco C. Billari (2009).  
  
This paper examined the relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) and the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in 143 countries.  

-  Download: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/extref/nature08230-s2.zip    
- Open a new R Script, set it up, and read.csv the data.
- Drop all but the HDI and TFR for 1975 and 2005 (use dplyr)


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data <- read.csv("data/nature08230-s2.csv")
data <- select(data, country, HDI.1975, TFR.1975, HDI.2005, TFR.2005)
```


## Digging In 

Explore the dataset. Make some plots. Do some calculations.
What do you see?

## Using lm()

- Use "lm(y ~ x)" to regress TFR on HDI for 1975. 
- Use "lm(y ~ x)" as lfit, and use "summary(lfit)."   
- What is the observed relationship?  
- Use the coefficient in a sentence.  
- Interpret the constant.  
 

## An lm() Object

- lm() doesn't just spit out values, it stores anything you could ever need  
- Use "str(lift)" to look at the structure of lfit. What's inside?  
- Can you print the coefficients?  
- Add the regression line to your scatter plot. 
- Can you print the true TFR and the predicted TFR side by side? (you will need to address the missing data issue)   
- Bonus: Instead of summary(lfit), try installing and using the "broom" package. Which one do you like better? (see ??broom for more information)
 
## Residuals

[Fortify and ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/0.9.3.1/fortify.lm.html)   

- See ?fortify.lm  
- Make a new scatter plot of the residuals versus the fitted values.

## Comparing 1975 to 2005

- Return to the original HDI-TFR scatter plot.  
- Add the 2005 data to your scatter plot in red.  
- Perform the HDI on TFR regression for 2005 data.  
- Add the new regression line to your plot.  
- Did the relationship change from 1975 to 2005?   
- Bonus: Make some aesthetic improvements to the graph
- Bonus: Make a new scatter plot of the residuals versus the fitted values for the 2005 data.
